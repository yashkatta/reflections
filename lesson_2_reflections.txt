What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It gernerates a repository for my project and terminal showing me that it is now in master directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is connected to git and status and add operates on staging area, staging area can contain
all the files that are added that is, we are gonna make commit for that file. Working directory also contains
untracked file.
